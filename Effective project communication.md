Email has long been the primary method of communication for many people in business, yet messages are easy to misunderstand or ignore. In this reading, we will discuss four principles of effective email writing that will help your emails to stand out, be remembered, and elicit the response you need. These principles are:
- State what you want clearly.

### Key takeaway
When you write an email, think about the people you are sending it to and what they need in order to quickly read and correctly understand it.Keeping these principles in mind when you draft emails will help you communicate more effectively with your team members, stakeholders, customers, and others. It can also demonstrate your level of professionalism and competence and inspire others’ confidence in your abilities. 

## Facilitating inclusive and accessible meetings
Inclusion of employees from different backgrounds and identities is extremely important for any organization looking to build a strong sense of connection in the workplace. Also, when team members feel included, they tend to want to do their best work. This is great for the organization, too. Creating an inclusive environment can be particularly challenging in meetings because they can be intimidating for participants. As a project manager, it is part of your job to facilitate meetings that are inclusive of all participants and that create a sense of emotional safety and value for everyone’s active input. In order to help facilitate inclusive meetings that feel empowering to everyone, you should put procedures in place that are consistently followed and predictable.

- **Formalize initial check-ins for the group that build understanding and ensure everyone knows their input is needed**. Create a process that consistently asks each person for an update on their work and/or how they are doing in their daily lives. Questions should be open-ended and vary over time to include some humor, analogies, and “finish the sentence” opportunities. As the project manager, your modeling will set the tone for the team dynamic, so always check-in with your team and model professionalism, vulnerability, and empathy. Popular check-ins include: “A highlight of my week has been . . .” and “This week I have gratitude for . . .” 

- **Give everyone your full attention**. Listen carefully to what everyone has to say and be careful not to interrupt someone who is speaking. Body language—such as maintaining eye contact and turning your body in the direction of a speaker—can help someone feel safe in voicing their opinion. Avoid head shaking, looking away, or looking at your phone when someone is speaking.

- **Help all participants to be heard**. Solicit ideas from participants, and ask questions to encourage participation. If someone gets interrupted, redirect everyone’s attention to that person and prompt them to finish their thought. If someone has not spoken yet, ask them what they think. It is important to note that, for some people, speaking up in meetings can be daunting. This can be especially true in virtual meetings or conference calls. This is also true for people who are not the majority in the room and may feel like they are representing an entire group of people who look, sound, or present like them. You may also find that people who are entry-level may be nervous about speaking up too since they are just beginning their careers. You can help people feel more comfortable and supported by letting them know ahead of time that they will be asked to share during a meeting so that they can prepare in advance. You can also solicit input after a meeting from anyone who did not speak.

- **Help participants feel comfortable sharing different perspectives**. Encourage differing or opposing ideas by making clear that alternate viewpoints are valued. To set the tone for this, start the meeting by encouraging competing perspectives. Try to get at least three points of view on an issue that might have some variation in the room. Follow up after the meeting with a request for additional thoughts. 

- **Use images that reflect the diversity of the world**. In your presentation materials and handouts, select images that illustrate diversity in race, gender, age, ability, cultural background, religion, geographical location, and so on. The people in your images should represent diverse backgrounds to further support inclusion, allowing everyone in the room to feel welcome and represented.

In summary, creating meetings that are inclusive and accessible to all participants will improve your team’s engagement, productivity, and morale.
